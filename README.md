# libi86

A reimplementation of non-standard C library facilities commonly used in classical MS-DOS programs, for use with a [GCC toolchain for 16-bit x86](https://github.com/tkchia/build-ia16/).

The current aim is to be compatible enough with the [Open Watcom](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2/) runtime to be useful for building existing MS-DOS code.
