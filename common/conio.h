 * To avoid conflict with the getch () and ungetch (.) routines in curses
 * library implementations, I define _getch () and _ungetch (.) in the
 * object files, and here declare getch () and ungetch (.) to be aliases for
 * the underscored names.
 *
 * For uniformity, I treat getche () and kbhit () the same way.  getche ()
 * is a bit of a special case, since it needs to be redirected differently
 * in Borland compatibility mode; see below.
 *
 * On the assembly source front, I also define weak symbols getch, getche,
 * etc. --- however, these are not actually used (by <conio.h>), and they
 * can be overridden.  Defining these non-underscored symbols allows
 * make-config.sh to spot them and proclaim them as being implemented.  :-)
 *
 * (Even with all this, it is probably still a bad idea to use both
 * <conio.h> and <curses.h> in the same C module.)
