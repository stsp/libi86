**``_mkdir`` and ``mkdir``**

  * ``libi86`` ignores any __mode__ argument that may be passed to ``mkdir`` or ``_mkdir``.
  * It might initially seem useful to use the __mode__ to change a newly created directory's attributes, via the ``_dos_setfileattr`` mechanism.  MS-DOS does allow one to mark a directory "read-only"; however, during actual file operations, MS-DOS still allows one to remove a "read-only" directory, or even to change such a directory's contents.  Thus, honouring the __mode__ is not very useful.  {back-link}
